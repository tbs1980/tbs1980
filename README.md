# 👋 Hi, I'm Sreekumar Thaithara Balan

I'm a machine learning researcher with a background in **Bayesian inference** and **scientific computing**, originally shaped by my research in astrophysics.

- 🧠 I design and scale ML systems that combine deep learning with probabilistic modeling.
- 🚀 My work spans from C++ simulations for exoplanet discovery to real-world ML products in real estate and finance.
- 🛠️ Core tools: **Python**, **C++**, **PyTorch**.
- ⚡ Special interest in **energy-efficient ML** and building lean, powerful models.
- 🔍 I like to **tinker with foundational models**, exploring efficient adaptations and domain-specific applications.
- 🌍 I’ve led teams delivering production-grade ML models that drive decisions and business impact.

📡 Currently open to collaboration opportunities in **AI research engineering** or **scientific ML**.

🛰️ **Fun fact:** I once co-wrote a C++ simulation to model the orbits of exoplanets — and accidentally discovered 3 new ones.

If you're working on something interesting in ML or science-inspired AI, I’d love to hear from you.
